# About Our Software

Our project seeks to create a Tycoon game on Roblox Studio, using the integrated game engine, Luau, Rojo, Blender, Git, along with various plugins/extensions.
  
Our project seeks to create a tycoon game on Roblox with a twist where you actively go out and fetch the resources required to create and upgrade buildings or NPCs. While outside of your land, you can fetch resources, battle enemy NPCs and collect gold, or have your own NPCs collect resources for you. You can use the resources you gain to build houses, farms, mines, or barracks that will be used to create food, spawn NPCs to collect resources, or fight with you. 

A unique aspect of our project is our decision to make it completely object-oriented, utilizing class hierarchies to manage data and properties as well as to provide compatibility with some of the aspects of our game such as mutex locking subclasses, or saving to the database.  

We were planning on implementing a strategic element to the combat system involving the player controlling combat NPCs of different types.
