# About Our Software

Our project seek to create a Tycoon game on Roblox Studio, using the integrated game engine, Luau, Rojo, Blender, Git, along with various plugins/extensions.
We are aiming to implement Object Oriented Programming to power the bots, and using Roblox's data centers to store players' save files.
The game has strategic elements and gives players the ability to switch point of views, control bots, or automate tasks to lessen hassle and improve immersion.
